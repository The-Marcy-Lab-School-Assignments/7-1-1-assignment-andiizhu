# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

The benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs) are:

- Faster interactions between pages, because there is no additional fetch and page refresh
- Better User Experience (because of faster interactions, there's a more seamless transition)
- DRY - More efficient - for React, you can use the same Components to re-render the page and is easier to maintain.
