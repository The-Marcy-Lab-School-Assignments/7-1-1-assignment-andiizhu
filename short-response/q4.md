# Question

Suppose you have an app that sells phones being served at `www.phones.com`. To view a single phone's details, the user navigates to the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5` where the number `5` is the id of a particular phone.

Using React Router, there is a corresponding route defined to render the `PhoneDetails` component:

```jsx
<Route path="/phones/:phoneId" element={<PhoneDetails />} />
```

Within the `PhoneDetails` component, `useParams` extracts the value of the `phoneId` path parameter (`5`) from the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5`

```jsx
const PhoneDetails = () => {
	const { phoneId } = useParams();

	// code to render the phone details
};
```

What is the data type of `phoneId`?

# Answer

The data type of `phoneId` would be a string. When `useParams()` extracts the values of the `phoneId` path parameter, the values will always be return as a string. Therefore, it may be relevant of converting the `phoneId` to a integer/number if you need to use the information to query a dataset like an API/Database. I think that JavaScript does some abstraction, but the server/database may be expecting an integer/number.
