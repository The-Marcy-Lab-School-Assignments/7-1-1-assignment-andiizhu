# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

1. Does not match, the path does not include any additional segments after the products.
2. Matches, the path parameter applies to any path that is exactly one segment after products and will replace `id` with `apple`.
3. Matches, the path parameter applies to any path that is exactly one segment after products and will replace `id` with `5`.
4. Does not match, the path includes an additional segment directly after `id`. Therefore, it doesn't exactly match the pattern of just one segment after products.
