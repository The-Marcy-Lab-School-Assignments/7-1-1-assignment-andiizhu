# Question

Is ReactRouter a package for **client-side routing** or **server-side routing**?

# Answer

ReactRouter is a package for client-side routing as it allows the client to navigate through different pages through the usage of routing. As a result, when clients click on another link on the webpage, the current page re-renders instead of redirecting the current page to a separate HTML file. This prevents the browser from having to send a fetch each time the client goes to a new link on the webpage.
