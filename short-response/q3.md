# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

It is appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router to all as a fallback to catch any URL's that are not defined for any specific Routes. It is usually the last `Route` in the `Routes` because if there are no matches to any of the previous `Route`, it will match to `"*"`. In most cases, this will be for a component for Not Found.
